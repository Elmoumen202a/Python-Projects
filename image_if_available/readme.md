# 🖼️ Python Image  (Dynamic Input)

## Overview
This project allows users to visualize images by typing the name of an image (e.g., "doge"). The program dynamically takes user input and displays the corresponding image if available. You can add as many images as you like and display them by simply typing their names! 🐕✨

## Features
- 🔍 **Dynamic Image Loading**: Enter the name of an image, and the program will search for it in the `images` folder.
- 🛑 **Input Flexibility**: Type `exit` to quit the program anytime.
- 🚫 **Error Handling**: If an image is not found, the program provides a user-friendly message.
- 🧪 **Unit Tests**: Ensure the functionality is reliable with built-in tests.

## How It Works
1. **Place Images**: Add your images to the `images/` folder in `.png` format.
2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
