# E-commerce Project

This project is a simple e-commerce application implemented in Python. It simulates a basic shopping cart system, allowing users to add items to a cart, calculate the total price of the items, and apply discounts. The project includes a main script (`main.py`) that demonstrates the functionality and a set of unit tests (`tests.py`) to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Features

- **Add Items to Cart**: Users can add items, each with a name and a price, to the shopping cart.
- **Calculate Total Price**: The total price of all items in the cart can be calculated.
- **Apply Discounts**: A discount can be applied to the total price of the items in the cart.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main functionalities of the e-commerce application, including the `Item` and `Cart` classes.
- `tests.py`: Contains the unit tests for the application to ensure the correctness of the functionalities.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to set it up and run it.
