# Strong Password Generator

This Python project generates strong passwords suitable for various purposes, including accounts and passwords for databases or other systems.

## The project consists of three files: 
    - main.py: This file contains the main implementation of the password generation algorithm.
    - tests.py: This file includes test cases to ensure the functionality of the password generation algorithm.
    - README.md: This markdown file provides an explanation of the project and instructions for usage.


## Usage

To generate a strong password, simply run `main.py`:


## Algorithm

The password generation algorithm works as follows:

1. It combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. It ensures that at least one character from each set is included in the password.
3. It randomly selects characters from all characters to fill the remaining password length.
4. It shuffles the generated password to mix up the characters.
