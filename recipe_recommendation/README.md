# Recipe Recommendation Project

This project recommends a recipe every day along with its preparation steps.

## Overview

This Python project utilizes a `RecipeRecommendation` class to generate a random recipe recommendation for the day. Each recipe is stored along with its corresponding preparation steps.

## `recipe_recommendation.py`

The `recipe_recommendation.py` file contains the main code for the recipe recommendation system. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **`RecipeRecommendation` class**: This class initializes with a dictionary containing various recipes as keys and their corresponding preparation steps as values.

- **`get_recipe_of_the_day()` method**: This method selects a random recipe for the current day and returns both the recipe name and its preparation steps.

## `tests.py`

The `tests.py` file contains unit tests to ensure the functionality of the `RecipeRecommendation` class. It verifies that the recommended recipe is within the list of available recipes.

## Usage

- Run the `recipe_recommendation.py` file to get today's recommended recipe.
