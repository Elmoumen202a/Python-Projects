# Code Language Detector

This project provides a simple tool to detect the programming language of a given code snippet.

## Project Structure
.
-main.py
-tests.py
-README.md

## Usage

The main logic for detecting the programming language is contained in `main.py`. To run the script with a sample code snippet, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```
## Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest tests.py


### Running the Project
1. Save the provided code into their respective files (`main.py`, `tests.py`, and `README.md`).
2. Run `python main.py` to test the language detection with a sample code snippet.
3. Run `python -m unittest tests.py` to execute the unit tests and verify the functionality.
