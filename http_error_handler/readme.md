# 🌐 HTTP Error Handler - Python Project 🚨

## 📖 Overview
Welcome to the **HTTP Error Handler** project! This Python program is designed to simulate and handle common HTTP errors like `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, and more. Whether you're a developer debugging API responses or learning about HTTP status codes, this project has you covered!

## 🚀 Features
- 💥 Handles various HTTP errors (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`, etc.)
- 🛠️ Custom error handling with meaningful messages.
- 📜 Logs error details to ensure you're always in the loop.
- ✔️ Easily extendable to handle even more HTTP status codes.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
📁 http_error_handler/ 
├── main.py # Main script to simulate HTTP requests and handle errors 
├── tests.py # Unit tests to ensure everything works smoothly 
├── requirements.txt # Dependencies required for the project

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone clone https://github.com/Elmoumen202a/Python-Projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** into the project directory:
    ```bash
        cd http-error-handler
    ```
3. **Install** the required dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
## 🧑‍💻 Usage :
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ``` 
- To run the unit tests:
    ```bash
    python tests.py

    ``` 

## 📋 Example : 

In main.py, we are simulating a 404 Not Found error by sending a request to https://httpstat.us/404. You can replace it with different URLs to simulate other status codes.

- Sample output:
    ``` 
    Error occurred: 404 Not Found

    ```
