# Chat AI

This project implements a simple chat AI that responds to user input based on predefined patterns.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to start the chat.
2. Type your messages when prompted.
3. To end the chat, type 'stop'.

## Customizing Responses

You can customize the AI's responses by modifying the `respond_to_user_input` function in `main.py`. Add or modify patterns and their corresponding responses as needed.

## Tests

To run tests, execute `tests.py`. Ensure you have the `unittest` module available.

```bash
python tests.py
