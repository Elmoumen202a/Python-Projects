# ðŸ§  Idea Analyzer and Visualizer ðŸŽ¨

## Overview
This Python project allows you to **analyze ideas** and visualize their keywords. It extracts key themes and creates a word cloud as a visual representation of the input text.

## Features
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identify key themes and their frequencies from the provided text.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generate and display a word cloud for better understanding.

## Libraries Used ðŸ“š
### 1. `wordcloud`
- This library is used to create word clouds from text data.
- It helps in generating visual representations where the size of each word indicates its frequency in the input text.

### 2. `matplotlib`
- A popular library for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations in Python.
- Used here to display the word cloud generated by the `wordcloud` library.

## Requirements
- Python 
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
1. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Input your idea when prompted.
3. View the generated word cloud in a graphical window.

## Example
**Input Idea**:  
```
Python is great for data analysis and visualization.
```
**Generated Word Cloud**:  
A graphical representation showing words like "Python", "great", "data", etc.

## Testing
Run the tests to ensure the functionality works as expected:
```bash
python tests.py
```
