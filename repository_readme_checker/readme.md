# Repository Readme Checker

This Python project checks repositories to see if they have a `readme.md` file. If the file is missing, it creates a new `readme.md` with a basic template.

## Files
- `main.py`: Contains the script to check repositories and create `readme.md`.
- `tests.py`: Unit tests for validating the functionality of `main.py`.
- `readme.md`: This file explains the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script with the base directory as input.

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
