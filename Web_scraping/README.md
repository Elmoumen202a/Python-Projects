# Web Scraping with scraper.py

This is a simple web scraping project using the web.py framework in Python. The project fetches data from a website using the `/scrape` route.

## Getting Started
I create a simple web application with one route /scrape, and when you access this route, it fetches the content of "https://example.com" using the requests library. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
