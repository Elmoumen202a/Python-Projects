# Common Words Counter

This Python project counts the frequency of common words in a given text. It consists of three files:

- `main.py`: Contains the main program to input text from the user, count the frequency of words, and display the top 10 common words.
- `tests.py`: Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the `count_words` and `common_words` functions in `main.py`.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining how to use the project and providing additional details.

## Usage

1. Enter the text when prompted. The program will then display the top 10 common words along with their frequencies.

## Testing

To ensure the correctness of the code, unit tests have been provided in `tests.py`. To run the tests, execute the following command:


This will run the tests defined in `TestWordCount` class and ensure that the `count_words` and `common_words` functions in `main.py` produce the expected results.
