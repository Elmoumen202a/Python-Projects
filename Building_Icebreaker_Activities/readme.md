3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Follow the instructions in `main.py` to participate in the icebreaker activities.

## Icebreaker Activities:

1. **Introduce Yourself:**
   - Each participant runs the script and introduces themselves, sharing their name, role, and one interesting fact about themselves.

2. **Two Truths and a Lie:**
   - Participants take turns running the script and sharing two truths and one lie about themselves. Others try to guess which statement is the lie.

3. **Virtual Scavenger Hunt:**
   - In this activity, the facilitator assigns items to find in participants' surroundings. Participants take turns sharing their findings via video or photo.

4. **Storytelling Time:**
   - Participants run the script and share a short, funny, or memorable story from their life or work experience.

Feel free to modify and expand upon these activities to suit your team's preferences and needs. Enjoy the team-building day!
