# üìù Word Count in Corrected Text

This project is a simple Python script that calculates the number of words in a provided corrected text. The text is stored in a multi-line string, and the script splits the text into words and counts them.

## How It Works

1. **Corrected Text:** The script contains a string `corrected_text` that holds the letter content.
2. **Word Count Calculation:** The script uses the `split()` method to break the string into words, and then it calculates the total number of words using `len()`.
3. **Output:** The total word count is printed as the output.
