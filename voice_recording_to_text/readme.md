# Voice Recording Project

This Python project allows you to record your voice and save it to a text file.

## Overview

This project consists of a simple voice recording utility implemented in Python. The `main.py` script uses the `sounddevice` library to capture audio input and saves it as a text file in the form of numpy array data. Additionally, there's a `test.py` script to demonstrate how to use the recording functionality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
