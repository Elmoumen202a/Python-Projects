# Text Mistake Checker

This Python project helps in detecting mistakes in text, such as spelling errors, grammar mistakes, and punctuation issues.

## Usage

1. Import the `check_text_mistakes` function from `main.py`.
2. Call the function with the text you want to check as input.
3. Receive a list of mistakes found in the text.

Example:

```python
from main import check_text_mistakes

text = "This is an example sentense with speling mistakes."
mistakes = check_text_mistakes(text)
print(mistakes)


4. **Additional Considerations:**
    - You can expand the project by adding features like suggestions for correcting mistakes, integration with external APIs (e.g., Grammarly), or building a simple GUI.
    - Ensure to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the users.
    - Write clean and well-documented code to make it easier for others to understand and contribute.

This is a basic outline to get you started. You can customize and expand the project according to your requirements and preferences.
