# 📊 Data Processing & Analysis Project

This project leverages the power of Python and the `pandas` library to load, process, and analyze datasets. With just a few lines of code, you can calculate basic statistics, filter data based on conditions, and gain insights from your data.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

- **`data.py`**: Contains the core functionality for loading, processing, and analyzing data using pandas.
- **`tests.py`**: Includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the data processing functions.
- **`readme.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and other relevant details.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the `pandas` library. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elmoumen202a/Python-Projects.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ddata_pandas
```

## 📝 Usage

To use the data processing script, place your dataset in the project directory as a CSV file and update the file path in `data.py`. Run the script to perform the analysis:

```bash
python data.py
```

You can customize the script to work with different datasets by modifying the columns and filtering conditions.

## 🧪 Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.py
```

These tests check the core functions for loading data, calculating statistics, and filtering results.

## 📚 About pandas

`pandas` is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to work seamlessly with structured data. Whether you're dealing with CSV files, SQL databases, or Excel sheets, pandas makes it easy to explore and process your data.

Pandas excels in:

- Handling missing data
- Merging and joining datasets
- Reshaping data
- Data cleaning
- Time series analysis
